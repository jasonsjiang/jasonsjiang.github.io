Hi! Iâ€™m Jason, a third year student at UC Berkeley studying applied mathematics. 

While I'm not working on academics, I enjoy cooking and [baking bread]({{site.url}}/assets/bread.jpg), making subpar [playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/1210283630?si=LEpp5zK4R3qf_hvxvXTSQg) (and of course, listening to them), and reading [cool books]({{site.url}}/books).
