First Year Student at UC Berkeley. 

Currently under construction.

### Stuff I've worked on, or have been working on:
__[Data Science Modules](https://github.com/ds-modules)__ <br>
Under UC Berkeley's Division of Data Sciences, I make Jupyter Notebooks for [LEGALST-190: Data, Prediction, and Law](https://github.com/ds-modules/LEGALST-190). I developed notebooks that cover [XML parsing](https://github.com/ds-modules/LEGALST-190/tree/master/labs/3-13) and [topic modelling](https://github.com/ds-modules/LEGALST-190/tree/master/labs/4-10).

I'm excited to say that I'll be a Modules team lead for the summer! <br> <br>


__[An exploration of the Billboard Top 100 songs](https://github.com/jasonsjiang/billboard-top-100-analysis/blob/master/billboard-exploration.ipynb)__<br>
I recently completed a personal project in which I explored the Billboard Top 100 songs form 1965 to 2015. In the notebook, I implemented topic models and many visualisations to answer the question I had when I approached this data set. I think that the notebook works best if you go through it so you can interact with the graphs (using ipywidgets), but feel free to look at it through the GitHub preview.
