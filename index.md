Hi, I'm Jason, a second year student at UC Berkeley studying math and data science.

### Stuff I've worked on, or have been working on:

#### [Data Science Education Program -- Modules](https://github.com/ds-modules) <br>

- Curriculum Developer: In Spring 2018, under UC Berkeley's Division of Data Sciences, I made Jupyter Notebooks for [LEGALST-190: Data, Prediction, and Law](https://github.com/ds-modules/LEGALST-190). I developed notebooks that cover [XML parsing](https://github.com/ds-modules/LEGALST-190/tree/master/labs/3-13) and [topic modelling](https://github.com/ds-modules/LEGALST-190/tree/master/labs/4-10).

- Team Lead: This summer, I continued working with the Division as a team lead. I had two projects this summer, working on UGBA-96: Data and Decisions with Professor Conrad Miller and ER-190C: Data, Environment, and Society with Professor Duncan Callaway. For UGBA-96, I lead a team of three developers implementing autograders for six Jupyter notebooks and for [ER-190C](https://github.com/ds-modules/ER-190C), I worked with six developers to create homeworks for this brand new course. <br>

I'm glad to say that I'll be continuing my work with the Division this Fall.


__[An exploration of the Billboard Top 100 songs](https://github.com/jasonsjiang/billboard-top-100-analysis/blob/master/billboard-exploration.ipynb)__<br>
This is a personal project in which I explored the Billboard Top 100 songs form 1965 to 2015. I implemented topic models and various visualizations and you can interact with the graphs! (Note: I used ipywidgets, so it does not work with GitHub preview ): ).
