First Year Student at UC Berkeley. 

Currently under construction.

### Some stuff I've been working on:
__[Data Science Modules](https://github.com/ds-modules)__ <br>
Under UC Berkeley's Division of Data Sciences, I make Jupyter Notebooks for [LEGALST-190: Data, Prediction, and Law](https://github.com/ds-modules/LEGALST-190). I developed notebooks that cover [XML parsing](https://github.com/ds-modules/LEGALST-190/tree/master/labs/3-13) and [topic modelling](https://github.com/ds-modules/LEGALST-190/tree/master/labs/4-10).

There will be more to come soon.

### Woah, more stuff about me.
